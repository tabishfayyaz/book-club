* Also known as Golang
* Go is a **statically typed** and **compiled** programming language. 
    * Statically typed means that variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time.
    * Compiled language means that it translates source code to machine code before execution.
* Go is not **truly object-oriented** like Java and C++ because it doesnâ€™t have the concepts of classes and inheritance. However, it does have a concepts of interfaces, with which much of the polymorphism can be implemented.
* Golang is a functional language, meaning that functions are the basic building blocks.
* Go is **statically typed**, making it a safe language that compiles to native code and has a very efficient execution. It is also **strongly typed**, which means according to the principle keep things explicit.
