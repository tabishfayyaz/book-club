**_compileSdkVersion_** - version of the API the app is compiled against

**_targetSdkVersion_** - not related to how your app is compiled or what APIs you can utilize but to indicate (upto & including) the version you have tested against

**_minSdkVersion_** - earliest version of Android that the app can run on

**Ideally:** `minSdkVersion (lowest possible) <= targetSdkVersion == compileSdkVersion (latest SDK)`
