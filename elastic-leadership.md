Elastic leadership is a framework and philosophy to help create self-organizing teams and realizing that leadership needs to change based on which phase your team is in.

Book is based on author personal experience of what worked and what didn't leading software teams.

We need to become better adjusted to the current reality and needs of our team, business and ourselves.

This book can help if you feel clueless about what your future team should be doing, if you feel helpless in leading your team to do the right things, you are broken and scared because of having no idea how to get out of a bad situation at work and you want to keep your head above water.

Team leaders around the world all suffer from some of the same basic bad experiences as most of weren't taught how to do this type of work. We want to not only create real value but also happy teams, both fulfilled and loyal.

Management done right is a very tough job.

**A good leader will challenge the team and people around them to solve their own problems and as people learn to solve their own problems, your time frees up more and more to do things you care more about.**

It takes time to challenge people and most teams don't have time in abundance. Making slack time to grow the team's skill will be necessary.

You and your team should always be getting out of your comfort zone to learn new things, nothing beats gaining new skills.

You can experiment with goals, constraints and the different leadership style described in this book. 

Experimentation is one of the most enjoyable and interesting things about being a leader.

Sometimes you must be the person who gets up and does something, 90% of success is stepping up to the plate.

Learning something truly new is neither easy nor simple, many times it's scary, annoying or discouraging to make you give up half way through the challenge.

A great challenge can be taken either gravely ("I'm facing an awful great challenge") or enthusiastically ("Wow, great challenge")

**LEADERSHIP MANIFESTO**

![Leadership Manifesto](https://github.com/tabishfayyaz/book-club/blob/master/images/leadership-manifesto.jpg)

The way to **measure our success** is through the overall growth in skills of self-organization & self-maintenance in each member of our team as well as the team as a whole.

We accept that what the team needs from us changes continuously based on their skills for handling the reality of work

We believe in challenging ourselves and our teams to always improve so:
- We create slack time for the team to learn and be challenged
- We embrace taking risks for our team over staying safe
- We embrace fear and discomfort while learning new skills over keeping people within their comfort zone
- We embrace experimentation (with people, tools, processes, work environment) over maitaining the status quo
- We believe our core practice is leading people so we welcome spending more time with our team than in meetings, treating software problems as people problems, learning people skills and communication techniques

There are three team phases: 
- Survival mode 
- Learning mode 
- Self-organization

It is hard to make positive changes in the work environment without the leadership skills and practiced outlined below.
