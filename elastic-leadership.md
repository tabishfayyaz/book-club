Elastic leadership is a framework and philosophy to help create self-organizing teams and realizing that leadership needs to change based on which phase your team is in.

Book is based on author personal experience of what worked and what didn't leading software teams.

We need to become better adjusted to the current reality and needs of our team, business and ourselves.

This book can help if you feel clueless about what your future team should be doing, if you feel helpless in leading your team to do the right things, you are broken and scared because of having no idea how to get out of a bad situation at work and you want to keep your head above water.

Team leaders around the world all suffer from some of the same basic bad experiences as most of weren't taught how to do this type of work. We want to not only create real value but also happy teams, both fulfilled and loyal.

Management done right is a very tough job.

**A good leader will challenge the team and people around them to solve their own problems and as people learn to solve their own problems, your time frees up more and more to do things you care more about.**

It takes time to challenge people and most teams don't have time in abundance. Making slack time to grow the team's skill will be necessary.
