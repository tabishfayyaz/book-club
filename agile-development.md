### What is Agile
- An iterative approach to project management
- Does not bet everything on a "big bang" launch
- Delivery in small but consumable increments
- Requirements, plans and result evaluated continuously so teams can naturally respond to change quickly
- Project lead or product owner typically prioritizes work but team is self-organizing and decides around tasks/assignments
- commitment to tight feedback and continuous improvement
- is not a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques
- Agile Manifesto (2001) does not prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size, it is just a set of core values that team decides how to live by (scrum, kanban, xp or a blend)
- increments lets team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into plans at minimal cost
- Scrum, XP, Kanban each incorporate the agile principles of frequent iterations, continuous learning and high quality in its own way
