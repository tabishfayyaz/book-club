### What is Agile
- An iterative approach to project management
- Does not bet everything on a "big bang" launch
- Delivery in small but consumable increments
- Requirements, plans and result evaluated continuously so teams can naturally respond to change quickly
- Project lead or product owner typically prioritizes work but team is self-organizing and decides around tasks/assignments
- commitment to tight feedback and continuous improvement
- is not a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques
- Agile Manifesto (2001) does not prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size, it is just a set of core values that team decides how to live by (scrum, kanban, xp or a blend)
- increments lets team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into plans at minimal cost
- Scrum, XP, Kanban each incorporate the agile principles of frequent iterations, continuous learning and high quality in its own way

### What is Scrum
- An agile project management framework for getting work done and continuously shipping value to customers, helps you think in Agile manner
- Product is built in series of iterations called **Sprints**
- Milestones give teams a sense of regular tangible progress
- Every few weeks the team plans which of the tasks from that backlog they'll work on
- **Ceremonies:** Throughout the sprint, the team participates in a number of events on regular basis
- Key ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum/Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospectives
- **Sprint Planning:** When your team decides what you want to accomplish during the next sprint
- **Daily Standup:** A super short meeting during each day of the sprint. The goal is to get everyone on same page, voice any concerns or things that may be blocking you from making progress towards the sprint goal
- **Sprint Review:** At the end of spring an informal session to view a demo, show off finished backlog items to product owner who approves them for the release. The product owner also reworks the backlog based on the current sprint that serves as starting point for the next sprint planning session.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Team talks about what worked well and what did not (project, people, relationships, tools or even certain ceremonies). The idea is to create a safe space to talk what needs to be improved next time
- Three primary roles in Scrum Framework: Product Owner, Scrum Master and the Development Team
- **Product Owner:** Champions for their product, main job is to bring the product vision to life and have a constant pulse on market and customer. They're focused on understanding business/market requirements and then prioritising the work that the development team will do
- **Scrum Master:** Scrum experts that coach developers, product owners and the business on the scrum proces and look for ways to fine-tune their practice
- **Development Team:** The developers and designers who do the work to accomplish sprint goals and collaborate with the product owner
- Through out the process your team will collect _Artifacts_ (like a tool to solve a problem)
- Three main artifacts that you'll continue to revisit and invest in over time: _Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog_ and the _Increment_ with YOUR definition of done.
- **Product Backlog:** Long list of stories, features, requirements, enhancers and fixes maintained by product owner
- **Spring Backlog:** Based off product backlog it is list of items of user stories that the development team is working on in the current sprint
- **Increment:** (also known as Sprint Goal) It is the usable end product from a sprint based on team's defintion of done regardless of whether or not it is actually shipped

#### Sprint Planning
- Helps focus on execution, minimize surprises and guarantee higher quality of code 
- Usually an hour per week of iteration
- Two hours for a two week sprint, ideally done early in the week so your team flow isn't disrupted by the weekend
- Usually discuss two key questions: In order to achieve the sprint goal what can we deliver during the upcoming sprint and how will we deliver that work
- Can be a three-step process: Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning Meeting, Creating Action Items 

#### Backlog Grooming (Story Time)
- Meeting before the meeting, usually developers cringe at it but they can be excused from it. 
- The purpose is to save time during the actual sprint planning session and make it more productive. 
- Best done beforehand in a separate meeting with the product owner and scrum master. 
- If items don't have enough details or need more information those gaps can be filled so that there aren't any blockers or time wasters during the actual sprint planning meeting

#### Sprint Planning Meeting
- A) Retrospective Recap B) Product & Marketing Updates C) Planning conversation
- Starts with Scrum Master presenting any relevant action items from the retrospective and then product owner provides any product or market updates
- Product Owner does the actual planning conversation (Sprint Goal + Velocity) by working with the development team
- One of the biggest challenge is often prioritization so a focused sprint goal and velocity will help
- The **Sprint Goal** is an objective that can be met by implementing stories from the backlog. It is guidance on why or purpose of the work
- **Velocity** is the amount of work typically completed in a sprint
- Once sprint goal and starting velocity is determined you plan the sprint which would be the longest part of sprint planning, do not rush it
- final step is to recap the plan and each person first action items and make sure there is no duplicated work

#### Daily Standups
- 15 minute daily meetings to plan for the next 24 hours
- Help eliminate other meetings, identify blockers and build a shared understanding of what everyone is working on
- Two commong ways to do standups: Round Robin (What did I work on yesterday, What am I working on today, What is blocking me) or Walking the Board (Team walks through all the work you have on your board, who owns it and if there are any blockers, move right to left so to talk about pieces of work that are closest to done)

#### Sprint Review Meetings or Demo
- Gather everyone (development, designer, writer ...)
- Rule of thumb: 5 minutes per person to demo their work
- Review from product backlog what's done and not done (Product Owner)
- Demo: what was done and why, time to review what was actually delivered before pushing to production (Development Team)
- Review key metrics, make sure what was demo-ed is going to move metrics (performance, customer behavior or measurable outcome etc.)
- Review and revise the product backlog (new user stories, remove old ones based on any findings in demo)

#### Retrospective
- After the sprint review and before next sprint planning meeting
- 30 minutes per week of iteration so 1 hour for a two-week sprint
- Everyone should attend
- Facilitator can be anyone in the team, might as well rotate
- A) Prepare B) Set the Stage C) What went well? D) What needs improvement? E) Next steps
- Remind everyone: _Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand_
- Leave the phones and laptops at the door and decide how far back are you going to retro.
- Distribute sticky notes, pens and encourage all participants to write down as many ideas (set a 3 - 5 minutes timer)
- Group similar ideas together to get a sense of any themes
- Repeat above for _What needs improvement_
- List action items for next steps and assign to owners with due date
