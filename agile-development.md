### What is Agile
- An iterative approach to project management
- Does not bet everything on a "big bang" launch
- Delivery in small but consumable increments
- Requirements, plans and result evaluated continuously so teams can naturally respond to change quickly
- Project lead or product owner typically prioritizes work but team is self-organizing and decides around tasks/assignments
- commitment to tight feedback and continuous improvement
- is not a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques
- Agile Manifesto (2001) does not prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size, it is just a set of core values that team decides how to live by (scrum, kanban, xp or a blend)
- increments lets team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into plans at minimal cost
- Scrum, XP, Kanban each incorporate the agile principles of frequent iterations, continuous learning and high quality in its own way


### What is Scrum
- An agile project management framework for getting work done and continuously shipping value to customers, helps you think in Agile manner
- Product is built in series of iterations called **Sprints**
- Milestones give teams a sense of regular tangible progress
- **Product Backlog:** Long list of stories, features, requirements, enhancers and fixes
- Every few weeks the team plans which of the tasks from that backlog they'll work on
- **Ceremonies:** Throughout the sprint, the team participates in a number of events on regular basis
- Key ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum/Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospectives
- **Sprint Planning:** When your team decides what you want to accomplish during the next sprint
- **Daily Standup:** A super short meeting during each day of the sprint. The goal is to get everyone on same page, voice any concerns or things that may be blocking you from making progress towards the sprint goal
- **Sprint Review:** At the end of spring an informal session to view a demo, show off finished backlog items to product owner who approves them for the release. The product owner also reworks the backlog based on the current sprint that serves as starting point for the next sprint planning session.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Team talks about what worked well and what did not (project, people, relationships, tools or even certain ceremonies). The idea is to create a safe space to talk what needs to be improved next time
- Three primary roles in Scrum Framework: Product Owner, Scrum Master and the Development Team
- **Product Owner:** Champions for their product, main job is to bring the product vision to life and have a constant pulse on market and customer. They're focused on understanding business/market requirements and then prioritising the work that the development team will do
- **Scrum Master:** Scrum experts that coach developers, product owners and the business on the scrum proces and look for ways to fine-tune their practice
- **Development Team:** The developers and designers who do the work to accomplish sprint goals and collaborate with the product owner
- The team, scrum master and product owner collect Scrum Artifacts as they go through each ceremony
